# Project Overview
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Swiggy's 2019 data to uncover key consumer behavior and operational trends. Examined daily session data, channel traffic, and key performance indicators to identify patterns in order volumes and conversion rates. Leveraged data analysis techniques to generate actionable insights that contributed to a 100% analysis score. This project demonstrated proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and deriving business-relevant conclusions.

# Key Insights

**Traffic Analysis**: 
Throughout the year, there were noticeable variations in traffic, with noteworthy surges around important events and marketing initiatives. On the other hand, drops in traffic were frequently attributed to increasing competition or technological problems.

**Order Levels**: 
Generally speaking, order levels followed traffic patterns, rising during times of heavy traffic and falling during times of low traffic. But other elements, such as typical delivery costs, sales, and out-of-stock merchandise, also significantly influenced order quantities.


**Conversion Rates**: 
The investigation showed that price, discounts, and technical difficulties had a significant impact on conversion rates at various points in the funnel, such as from the menu to the cart and the cart to the payment page.
